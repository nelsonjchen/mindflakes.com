I just compiled a version of keycastr and put it here since I could not find a precompiled version that's relatively
new.

Keycastr is used for presentational demos. It's free and the source is here in this github repo. You will need a
modern version of Xcode to compile it.

The version that is compiled is by [creemama](https://github.com/creemama). I only blindingly updated the settings
with Xcode recommendations. This "works for me" on OS X 10.8.3.
