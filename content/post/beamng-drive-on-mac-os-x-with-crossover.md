Gotta make this quick. This post will change.

Here's how to get [BeamNG Drive][] working in Mac OS X. I'm sure there are equivilent instructions for [Wineskin][]
but I have no time to find out.

Make a new bottle in Crossover. Make sure it is a Windows Vista bottle. Run the Wine configuration setting inside it
and set the version to Windows 7 in one of the sheets. Enable the Mac Driver so you don't run it through X11.

Install the Modern DirectX runtime into it. Install BeamNG into it. Mute your speakers. Change the audio options to
use OpenAL for output. Unmute speakers. Enjoy.

So far this works for the tech demo. I'm going to try it on Alpha later.

UPDATE: It works on Alpha. Yay!
