It's been near a year since I supercharged [GitHub Wiki SEE][ghwsee] with dynamically generating sitemaps.

Since then a few things have changed:

* GitHub has started to permit a select set of wikis to be indexed.
* They have not budged on letting un-publically editable wikis be indexed.
* There is now a star requirement of about 500, and it appears to be steadily decreasing.
* Many projects have reacted by moving or configuring their wikis to indexable platforms.

As a result, traffic to [GitHub Wiki SEE][ghwsee] has dropped off dramatically.

This is a good thing, as it means that GitHub is moving in the right direction.

I'm still going to keep the service up, as it's still useful for wikis that are not yet indexed and there are still about 400,000 wikis that aren't indexed.

Hopefully GitHub will continue to move in the right direction and allow all wikis to be indexed.
