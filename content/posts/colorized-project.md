On IntelliJ IDEs, I've been using [Project-Color][pc] to set a color for each project. This is useful for me because I have a lot of projects open at once, and it's nice to be able to quickly identify which project is which.

Unfortunately, Project-Color [hasn't been updated in a while](https://github.com/nowtilous/Project-Color/issues/), and it doesn't work with the latest versions of IntelliJ.

After a few months of using IntelliJ without Project-Color, I decided to try to fix it. I've released the result as [Colorized-Project][cp].

Thre are a few rough edges, but it's mostly functional. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and it's been working well. I've also submitted it to the JetBrains plugin repository as well.

It still needs some polish like a nicer icon, and I'd like to add a few more features.
