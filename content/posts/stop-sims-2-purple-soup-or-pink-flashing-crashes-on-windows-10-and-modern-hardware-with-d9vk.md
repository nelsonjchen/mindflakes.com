Wrote a guide on how to fix the Purple Soup or Pink Flashing Crashes for
The Sims 2 on Windows 10 1903+ on powerful gaming computers. It's great to make
this accessible again to gamers with powerful gaming computers.

Guide Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19JMr-FQSU3AlF7Kyvcrr7awTiHBDQSUNLG6qfaI6rOs/edit#

General idea: Replace Microsoft DirectX 9 with D9VK.

D9VK is actually actively developed and fixes bugs. It also translates graphics
to a stack that is more open and stable.


So this:

Turns to this:
